# GoRaku

Making entertainment into language study

## Concept

Traditional language study can be boring (reading through grammar books, looking up boring words from the dictionary). That's where GoRaku comes in!

GoRaku aims to assist language learners who enjoy watching shows or anime in their target language. GoRaku can take an audio clip in the target language and automatically turn that audio into a text flash card with a front and back. The front is the original audio changed to text, and the back is the translation of the front text to english. GoRaku also lets you store these cards to study later.
